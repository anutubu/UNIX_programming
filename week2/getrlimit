int getrlimit(int resource, struct rlimit *rlim);

The getrlimit() system calls get resource limits respectively.

struct rlimit {
	rlim_t rlim_cur; /*soft limit*/
	rlim_t rlim_max; /*hard limit (ceiling for rlim_cur)*/
};

The soft limit is the value that the kernel enforces for the corresponding resource. 
The hard limit acts  as  a  ceiling  for  the  soft
       limit:  an  unprivileged process may set only its soft limit to a value
       in the range from 0 up to the hard limit, and (irreversibly) lower  its
       hard   limit.

RLIMIT_NOFILE the max  no. of files for this process.
